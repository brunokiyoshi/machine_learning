# machine_learning
This repo contains Machine Learning  ML programs I've coded, mostly, for course projects.
Some of the courses I have followed include but are not limited to:
  - Udacity's "Machine Learning Engineer" Nanodegree
  - Udemy's "Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks" course
  - My master's degree's at UFSC "Aprendizado de Máquina" ("Machine Learning") course
